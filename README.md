# Array Partitioning

Divide a given array of numbers into two subarrays such that the **absolute difference** between their sums is the smallest possible. For example, the array **[2, 5, 4, 7, 15, 20]** can be divided into subarrays **[15, 7, 4]** and **[20, 5, 2]**. The difference between the sums of those arrays is **1**, and it is the smallest.

> The first line of the input contains the size of the array. The next
> line contains the array elements.   Print the subarrays and the
> difference of their sums.

####  For example:
Input: 
6
4, 15, 20, 2, 7, 5 
 
Output: 
[15, 7, 4] 
[20, 5, 2] 
1 
(The sum of the first subarray is **26**, the sum of the second subarray is **27**, the difference is 1.)
